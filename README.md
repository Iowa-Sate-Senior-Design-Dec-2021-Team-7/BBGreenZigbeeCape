### Scope:
	Research a new or existing wireless technology and add it to the BeagleBone Green and build an IoT network to demonstrate its new capabilities.

### Stretch scope:
	1. Create a system of printed circuit boards to connect to the Zigbee network to show the capabilities and use cases of the Zigbee network.
	2. Program and debug the CC1352 microcontroller Using UART.

---

### Requirements (in no particular order):
	1. Create printed circuit board to allow the BeagleBone to connect to a Zigbee network.
	2. TODO SOFTWARE

### Directory Roles:
	- hardware: for pcb designs created and other hardware-specific resources
	- firmware: for code being deployed on the BeagleBone Green Gateway, IoT cape, or other created daughter boards
	- software: for code not being deployed on a hardware module. i.e. web-servers, apps, and other non-controller code
	- docs: for project documents and classwork
